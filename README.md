# more_mob_heads (v3.0.0)

More Mob Heads extends the loot tables of all mobs in the game, making it possible for them to drop their own heads when killed by a player. The probability depends on how rare the mobs are and whether it's possible to build a farm for them. Many mobs (such as cats, sheep, rabbits,...) also drop different kinds of heads depending on their appearance. Others have multiple heads that drop randomly and some even have special varients of heads that only drop under certain conditions. Last but not least, there are some heads that can only be found in loot chests (such as in desert temples).

**Good luck and catch them all!**

As an admin, it is also possible to get an overview of all the heads in the game by using the function *more_mob_heads:all_heads*. This will give you a structure block, which when used will place several chests in the displayed area where you can find all heads sorted by category.

**Requires [nuhser_core](https://github.com/Nuhser/nuhser_core "Nuhser_Core") to be installed first!**
